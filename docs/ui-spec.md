# UI spec — Mini-ATS

The specification for the frontend. Visual reference: `docs/prototype.html` (open it in a browser).

Lovable built the UI from this spec in ATS-1. The free Lovable credits ran out after the build, so Claude Code reviews the result against this spec and fixes the gaps in ATS-2.

## Goal

The frontend for a mini ATS (applicant tracking system) for small Swedish companies that recruit. Clean, fast and ready to show a first customer.

Until epic 1 the UI runs on **typed mock data in memory**. Epics 1–4 replace the mock with Supabase. The spec is written so that swap only touches `src/lib/api/` and `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.

## Ground rules

- UI text in Swedish by default, with English as a second language through i18n (ATS-3). Code, file names and comments in English.
- React, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query. @dnd-kit for drag and drop, with pointer and touch sensors. (The spec asked for React Router. Lovable used its TanStack Start template with TanStack Router instead, which is kept. See `docs/review-ats-1.md`.)
- No Supabase, no real authentication and no database before epic 1.

## Roles

- **Admin:** runs the platform. Creates admin and customer accounts. Can do everything a customer can do, on a customer's behalf.
- **Customer:** a recruiting company with one login. Creates jobs, adds candidates and moves them through a pipeline.

## Data model

TypeScript types in `src/types/index.ts`. Fields are snake_case to match the database. Dates are ISO strings.

- `Profile`: id, role (`"admin" | "customer"`), full_name, company_name, email, created_at
- `Job`: id, customer_id, title, description, location, status (`"open" | "closed"`), created_at
- `Candidate`: id, customer_id, full_name, email, phone, linkedin_url, notes, created_at
- `Application`: id, customer_id, job_id, candidate_id, stage, position, stage_changed_at, created_at, updated_at
  - stage: `"new" | "screening" | "interview" | "offer" | "hired" | "rejected"`
  - Swedish labels: Ny, Screening, Intervju, Erbjudande, Anställd, Avböjd

An application links one candidate to one job and is one card on the kanban board. A candidate can be linked to several jobs.

## Data access

- All data functions live in `src/lib/api/`, one file per entity: `profiles.ts`, `jobs.ts`, `candidates.ts`, `applications.ts`. They are async and take `customerId` as an explicit argument where data belongs to a customer.
- The mock store lives in `src/lib/api/mockStore.ts`. Every mock call waits about 300 ms so loading states are visible.
- TanStack Query hooks in `src/hooks/`: `useJobs`, `useCandidates`, `useApplications`, `useProfiles`, plus mutations.
- Every query key that returns customer data includes the active customer id, for example `["jobs", customerId]`. Switching customer must never show the previous customer's cached data.
- Moving a card uses an optimistic update and rolls back with a toast if the call fails.
- Components never import the mock store.
- Mock data: 1 admin, 2 customers ("Nordkust Bygg AB" and "Studio Lumen"), 3–4 jobs each and about 15 candidates per customer spread across all stages. Only obviously fake people and `.test` email addresses.

## Auth (mock now, Supabase later)

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` with `useAuth()` exposing: `user`, `profile`, `role`, `isLoading`, `signIn(email, password)`, `signOut()`.
- The mock implementation lives only in `AuthContext`.
- Route guards: `RequireAuth` redirects signed-out users to `/login`. `RequireAdmin` redirects customers to `/pipeline`.
- The demo login buttons live in `src/components/auth/DemoLogin.tsx`, so they can be removed in ATS-6.
- `signOut()` clears the TanStack Query cache.

## Active customer

- `src/contexts/ActiveCustomerContext.tsx`. For a customer it is always themselves. For an admin it is the customer chosen in a picker in the header.
- Every customer screen (jobs, candidates, pipeline) shows and creates data for the active customer only.
- An admin with no customer chosen sees "Välj en kund att arbeta som" with one card per customer instead of data.
- An admin acting for a customer sees a banner: "Du arbetar som [företagsnamn]" with a button to leave.

## Pages

1. **`/login`:** email and password form with Swedish error messages. Below it, `DemoLogin` with buttons to log in as the admin or either customer.
2. **`/pipeline`** (start page after login), the kanban board:
   - One column per stage, in order. The column header shows the stage name and the number of cards.
   - Compact cards: candidate name, job title, and days in the current stage computed from `stage_changed_at`. Small enough that many fit on screen.
   - Drag a card to another column to change its stage. Changing stage sets `stage_changed_at` to now.
   - Clicking a card opens a side sheet with the candidate's details, LinkedIn link (new tab), notes, and the jobs they are linked to.
   - Filters above the board: a job dropdown (all jobs or one job) and a name search that filters as you type. Both live in the URL as `?job=<job id>&q=<text>`.
   - A clear empty state when no cards match.
   - The board scrolls horizontally on mobile.
3. **`/jobs`:** table with title, location, status and number of candidates. Create and edit in a dialog. Close and reopen a job.
4. **`/candidates`:** table with name, email and LinkedIn. Create and edit in a dialog: name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL (must be a linkedin.com URL), notes, and one or more jobs to link to. A new link starts in "Ny".
5. **`/admin/accounts`:** admin only. Table with name, company, email, role and created date. A dialog to create an account: role, name, company, email and a temporary password.

## Layout and design

- Follow `docs/prototype.html` for layout, density and visual style.
- Left sidebar: Pipeline, Jobb, Kandidater, and for admins Konton. Collapses to a menu on mobile.
- Header: the active customer picker (admins only) and a user menu with logout.
- Calm B2B look: light neutral background, white surfaces, one accent color used sparingly, good contrast. No gradients.
- Desktop first, but every page works at 390 px wide.
- Every list and the board have loading, empty and error states.
- Customers never see or reach admin pages.

## Tests

Vitest unit tests for the pure helpers: days in stage, LinkedIn URL validation, and reading and writing the pipeline filters from the URL.
