# Review Findings → GitHub Issues — Mini-ATS

Reads the most recent review report in this conversation and creates one GitHub issue per finding.

**Every issue is created by running the `ats-create-ticket` skill.** Never call `gh issue create` directly. That keeps numbering, labels, milestones and templates the same as every other ticket.

The argument is: `$ARGUMENTS`

---

## Step 1 — Find the report

Look back in this conversation for the most recent output of one of these:

- `/ats-epic-review` (sections Blockers and Warnings)
- `/ats-review-pr` (the Issues table)
- any other code review or audit with severities

If there is none, stop:
> No review report found in this session. Run `/ats-epic-review` or `/ats-review-pr` first, then run `/ats-audit-to-issues`.

---

## Step 2 — Extract the findings

| Report severity | Issue type | Priority label |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Blocker / epic-review Blockers | `fix` or `chore` | `priority:high` |
| 🟡 Warning / epic-review Warnings | `fix` or `chore` | `priority:medium` |
| 🟢 Suggestion | `chore` | `priority:low` |

Type per finding:
- Security problem, runtime bug or broken acceptance criterion → `fix`, plus the `security` label for security findings
- Missing test, missing state, code quality, design token or hygiene → `chore`

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `blockers`, only take the blockers.

Show the list of findings that will become issues and wait for the developer to confirm before creating anything.

---

## Step 3 — Create the issues one by one

Run `ats-create-ticket` once per finding, blockers first, then warnings, then suggestions. Pass a complete description in this shape:

```
<fix|chore>: <short imperative title describing the fix>

Severity: <🔴 Blocker / 🟡 Warning / 🟢 Suggestion>
Labels: <priority:high|medium|low>, <security if relevant>
Milestone: <current epic>
File: <path:line if known>
Category: <Security / RLS / Data layer / TypeScript / UI / Tests / Hygiene>

Problem:
<The exact finding from the report>

Why it matters:
<One sentence on the risk>

Suggested fix:
<A targeted fix, not a rewrite>

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] AC1: <the fix, testable>
- [ ] AC2: <the regression test or check that proves it>

Source: /ats-audit-to-issues from <report name>, <date>.
```

Example:

```
fix: Check Supabase error before using data in listJobs

Severity: 🔴 Blocker
Labels: priority:high
Milestone: Epic 2 — Jobs and candidates
File: src/lib/api/jobs.ts:8
Category: Data layer

Problem:
listJobs returns data without checking error. A failed query renders an empty list instead of the error state.

Why it matters:
The customer sees "Inga jobb än" when the real problem is a failed request, and cannot retry.

Suggested fix:
Throw when error is set so TanStack Query reaches the error state.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] AC1: listJobs throws when Supabase returns an error
- [ ] AC2: The jobs page shows ErrorState with "Försök igen" when the request fails

Source: /ats-audit-to-issues from /ats-epic-review 2, 2026-10-10.
```

`ats-create-ticket` runs its own duplicate check. If it finds the same problem already ticketed, skip the finding and note it.

---

## Step 4 — Report

```
## Issues created from <report name>

| Priority | ATS | Issue | Title |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 high | ATS-N | #n | <title> |
| 🟡 medium | ATS-N | #n | <title> |

Total: N issues (X high, Y medium, Z low). Skipped: <findings skipped and why, or "none">.
```

## Rules

- Always go through `ats-create-ticket`. Never `gh issue create` directly
- One issue per finding. Never bundle findings
- Never create an issue for something that is not in the report
- Skip findings without a file or a clear description, and list them as skipped
- Never create duplicates
