# Git Ship — Mini-ATS

Ships the current `ats/ATS-<N>-...` branch and opens a PR to `main`. Run every step in order.

`git push` and `gh pr create` are deliberately **not** in `allowed-tools`: Claude Code asks before each, as `CLAUDE.md` requires. Running this skill is the developer's request to ship, so say yes to those prompts.

Never run this skill unattended (`CLAUDE.md` § Working on your own).

The optional argument is: `$ARGUMENTS`

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
```

---

## Step 1 — Verify the branch

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

- On `main`: **stop**. Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed. Use `ats-git-branch-and-ship`
- The branch must follow `ats/ATS-<N>-...`. Extract `ATS-<N>`
- Find the issue:
  ```bash
  gh issue list --repo "$REPO" --state all --search "ATS-<N> in:title" --json number,title,url,body --limit 10
  ```
  Use the one whose title starts with exactly `[ATS-<N>]`. Note its number and URL. If none exists, warn and continue without `Closes`

---

## Step 2 — Validation

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
npm run build
```

All four must pass. If the branch touches `supabase/`, the RLS tests must have passed locally or be noted for CI (see `ats-implement-ticket` § Validation).

**If anything fails, stop and fix it before continuing.**

---

## Step 3 — Sync with main

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

On conflicts, **stop and report**. Never resolve conflicts automatically. After a rebase, run Step 2 again.

---

## Step 4 — Commit what is left

1. `git status` and `git diff --stat`
2. Clean working tree: go to Step 5
3. Otherwise commit with `ats-git-commit`: logical groups, files staged by name, never `git add .`
4. **If a commit fails, stop**

---

## Step 5 — Push

1. Show the branch's commits: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
2. Check every subject follows `(MODEL_NAME) <type> [ATS-<N>] ...` and list any that do not
3. Push:
   - No upstream: `git push -u origin <branch>`
   - Upstream set: `git push`
4. Never force-push. `.claude/settings.json` blocks it. If a rebase means an already-pushed branch needs `git push --force-with-lease`, stop and ask the developer to run it themselves

**If the push fails, stop.**

---

## Step 6 — Open the PR

Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` if it exists, filled in. Otherwise use this body:

```markdown
## [ATS-<N>] <Title>

Closes #<issue number>

### Summary
<One or two sentences: what was built and why.>

### What Changed
1. **Database** — <migrations, RLS, or "Not touched">
2. **Edge Functions** — <or "Not touched">
3. **Data layer** — <src/lib/api, src/hooks, or "Not touched">
4. **UI** — <routes, components, or "Not touched">
5. **Tests** — <or "Not touched">

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] AC1: <text>
- [ ] AC2: <text> — <why not done>

### Manual Test Steps
1. <Step, including which role: admin acting for a customer, customer A, customer B>

### Tradeoffs
- <Decisions, deferrals, new dependencies, schema changes>

### Validation
- lint / tsc / test / build ✅
- RLS tests: ✅ locally / CI
```

```bash
gh pr create --repo "$REPO" --base main --title "<type> [ATS-<N>] <Title Case Summary>" --body "<body>"
```

- Title: `<type> [ATS-<N>] Title Case Summary`, where type is the main commit type
- `Closes #<number>` must be in the body so the issue closes when the PR merges
- Show the PR URL to the developer

---

## Step 7 — After the PR is open

- Tell the developer to wait for both CI jobs (app and RLS) and the Vercel preview before merging
- Suggest running `ats-review-pr <number>` before merging
- Tick the completed ACs on the issue only if the developer says yes:
  ```bash
  gh issue edit <number> --repo "$REPO" --body "<body with verified items changed to - [x]>"
  ```

---

## Completion checks

- [ ] Branch is not `main` and follows `ats/ATS-<N>-...`
- [ ] lint, tsc, test and build pass. RLS tests passed or noted for CI
- [ ] Rebased on `origin/main` without conflicts
- [ ] Files staged by name, commits follow the format, no `--no-verify`
- [ ] Push succeeded, no force-push
- [ ] PR to `main` with the template filled in and `Closes #<number>`
- [ ] PR URL shown
