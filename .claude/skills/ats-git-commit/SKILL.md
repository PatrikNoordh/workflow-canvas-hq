# Git Commit Format — Mini-ATS

Commit format for every Claude-assisted commit in Mini-ATS. Same format as `CLAUDE.md` § Workflow.

## Format

```
(MODEL_NAME) <type> [ATS-<N>] <imperative description>
```

Replace `MODEL_NAME` with the **actual model running this session**. Never hardcode a model name.

Examples:
```
(claude-opus-5-5) chore [ATS-2] Switch from bun to npm with package-lock
(claude-opus-5-5) style [ATS-2] Apply Prettier formatting with eslint --fix
(claude-opus-5-5) feat [ATS-6] Replace mock AuthContext with Supabase Auth
(claude-opus-5-5) fix [ATS-13] Clear job filter when admin switches customer
(claude-opus-5-5) test [ATS-2] Cover LinkedIn URL rule shared with the database
```

Take `ATS-<N>` from the branch name (`ats/ATS-<N>-...`). If the branch has no ticket id, stop and ask which ticket the work belongs to.

## Types

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| `feat` | New feature or behaviour |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting or visual-only change, no logic change |
| `refactor` | Restructure, no behaviour change |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `chore` | Config, tooling, dependencies, CI |

## Before every commit

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
npm run build
```

All four must pass. `npm run build` does not type-check on this stack, so `tsc` is not optional. If the commit touches `supabase/`, also run the RLS tests (see `ats-implement-ticket` § Validation).

## Splitting into several commits

1. `git status` and `git diff --stat` to survey the changes
2. Group by **what changed and why**, not by file
3. Order: database (migrations, RLS tests) → Edge Functions → data layer (`src/lib/api/`, `src/hooks/`) → UI (`src/routes/`, `src/components/`) → tests → docs
4. Stage each group by name with `git add <files>`. Never `git add .` or `git add -A`
5. Every commit must build and pass on its own

## Rules

- The ticket id repeats on every commit in the branch
- Imperative mood, subject under 72 characters, no body
- Never add a `Co-Authored-By` footer or other attribution. The `(MODEL_NAME)` prefix already says who wrote it
- Never `--no-verify`
- Never commit `.env*.local`, secrets or the Supabase service role key
- Never commit directly on `main`
